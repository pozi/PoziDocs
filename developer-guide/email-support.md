# Email Support

When clients send an email to [support@pozi.com](mailto:support@pozi.com), an issue is created in the Help Scout service, and nominated service agents are notified by email.

If a client sends an email directly (ie, not via Help Scout), the email can be forwarded to support@pozi.com to be added to the support ticket system. To automatically assign yourself, add `@me` to the email body.
